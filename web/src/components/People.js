    cell biology and immunology.  
    Our laboratory investigates the development of mouse hematopoietic cells as they mature from the hematopoietic stem 
    cells to myeloid and lymphoid cell types. Stem cells interact closely with their microenvironmental niche resulting in 
    stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. We have been particularly focused on comparing the development of bone marrow 
    niche and thymic microenvironments at the fetal and adult stages, as well as the signal transduction pathways and
    specific genes that are important in the regulation of the development of the diverse cell types in each 
    microenvironment.  In recent years, we have joined the field of osteoimmunology, which studies the interactions 
    between the skeletal and immune systems.
